# viewer

A simple and re-usable web app for viewing and exploring geo-localized risk and environmental data requiring only a static web server.

Code based on the (riskCOVID prototype webapp repo)[https://github.com/riskyviz/webapp/]

The viewer is currently set up to display CAMS european air pollution forecasts and is hosted at https://visualtopology.com/air_pollution/  

However, it is intended to be easily customisable for displaying and communicating other enviromental datasets to the public.

## Customising for other applications

Documentation TODO covering configuration files and the `geosharded` geojson data file format
